Closing thought: Owning a firearm will never protect you, being trained to use it effectively will.""It also seems absurd that they might work to stop a confiscation effort before it got started, since the only sentiment I've ever heard expressed here or elsewhere is ""gun control loses elections""."Just look at the history of California and gun rights loss."Democracy won, and bureaucracy lost, said Nevadans for Sound Government attorney Joel Hansen, who praised the judge's ruling as historic for Nevada.""A tragedy for firearms (obviously), but also a tragedy for personal liberty, one of the key tenants of our country.""A vote on Thursday fell one shy of bringing the bill up for debate, leaving only one day left for consideration.""BHUTTO: I know that that's an argument that some of the supporters of the military regime say, that elections in Pakistan could give up a Hamas-type solution, but that's not what the polls show, that's not what the elections have shown.""Imagine not only the above but stir in the fact that you currently belong to, and are senior officials, of your political party and it is basically illegal for you to campaign for the overthrow of the government.""Modern Liberalism's many accomplishments, like the war on poverty that ended with the unconditional surrender of poverty, are just intimidating."That alone is more than enough to reverse and defeat gun control."The Money and the Power asks, in fact, whether the ""national surrender of democracy to oligarchy--the submission to house rules, as they might put it on the Strip""--has gone on too long to be reversed."It completely glosses over the abject surrender of government from the policy making exercise."Benazir Bhutto may have been killed by terrorists, but the terrorists must not be allowed to kill democracy in Pakistan, said British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.""Using data to challenge the government, the percentage of funds arriving at Ugandan schools eventually rose to 90 percent, with a typical school headmaster printing data and posting on the school door, to meet parental demands.""In no way do our efforts challenge the right to bear arms.""""Everything changed in the 1970s when conservative groups challenged gun control and overturned laws in state legislatures, giving the Second Amendment a new interpretation considered by liberals and conservatives alike to be one of the biggest pieces of fraud on the American public.""Environmental activists have challenged the government on hydroelectric and other infrastructure projects, intellectuals have submitted petitions criticizing authoritarian policies, and rural farmers are forming associations to protect their collective interests.""Socialist parties also challenged governments, particularly during the Great Depression, to tackle the inequalities that were still widespread in democratic and wealthy nations.""And if there is to be no top armament level, can your guns compete with a howitzer?""And if there is to be no top armament level, can your guns compete with a howitzer?""And how can a few guns compete against tanks, artillery, air strikes, guided missiles etc.. ?

lobby did not ""win."""for the first question yes why would my country do anything against me? like even the arabs both muslim and christians(not the palestinians in the west bank and gaza) never protested to own guns or said they dont feel safe here.. and also i read here that people hold guns to go against the country in time of need now you think that a bunch of 30-40 years old men with 1920's-2000's guns can win a tank or an air plane? or an air craft carier?"I oppose machine-gun bans, 'assault-weapon' bans, mag limits, background checks, perches/own/carry permits of any kind, 90% of all gun-free zones (to include private businesses open to the public), registration...etc."My point was that most gun-haters are ignorant to the point that they would oppose an imaginary gun.Mr. Bloomberg said last week that he would work to defeat Republicans and Democrats alike who opposed gun control.I think we might have found the reason Paralogic opposes gun ownership!Opposing gun control doesn't mean I can't loathe gun culture.Your silly denials are just that Obama has put people on the Supreme Court who have stated that individual citizens have no Second Amendment rights He has supported banning guns based on their features or looks He has supported complete gun registration and WHAT IS THE DOWNSIDE FOR pro rights advocates opposing any gun law your polished turd wants to pass?"Apparently, some far left gays figure they can get even by opposing gun rights figuring most or a majority of gun owners are hostile to their ""Gay rights"". many of the most idiotic anti gun arguments I have heard have come from militant gays."Gun control will never be defeated until gun control and it supporters are driven out to sea."Every since then we've had this endless, mindless debate about guns, gun history, the evil NRA, assault weapon use on elementary school children once or twice per century, and many other inane premises used to try and kill gun ownership.""Where will the trillions of dollars needed to eradicate extreme poverty by December 12th 2012, come from?""Shotgun News columnist Jeff Knox wrote, ""The gun rights community should make

paragraph from your post above -- You accurately describe, once again, the pro-gun team's tactics against other posters on HuffPost and any honest discourse."Wealth trumps income when looking at within achievement level impact on college attendance."Together, you and I CAN defeat the Internet sales tax, but you must take action now!""Yes, there are people revealing facts, educating people, having meetings and organizing opposition to those who would destroy the 2nd Amendment."What might harm our gun rights is this recent insistance on felons etc being able to buy firearms.Consumer-Driven Culture Is Killing Our DemocracyKilling Poverty Has the corruption in Kenya lessened under its new president?The US kills democracy and kisses dictators!The only use it ever had or will have is to the gun control community of lunatics who infect the world with their insanity."Seriously, don't go by anything that guy said, and don't think for a second that this idiot represents everyone in the firearms community."I have a right to defend my gun rights and will to the end.Apparently the simple fact that some 80% of households have a gun and that only 12% of the population support less gun control has no influence on your false belief that gun owners will vote to defend their firearms.Thomas defended voluntary poverty as good because it frees people from vices related to wealth.But nobody's in there defending the taxpayer."What is curious is how people furiously defend gun rights, while don't for other weapons.""If you disagree with a gun ban, then don't come here and defend a gun ban."These actions caused the NRA and gun owners to get political and counterattack the Dem schemes the Dem solution changed to punishing the pro gun groups who funneled lots of money to pro gun (usually GOP) candidates. that is why we conservatives have become more active in defending gun rights-because Dem assholes in office wanted to rape our rights to stave off attacks that Dems are weak on dealing with violent street crimeWhy do we accept that guns kill and join in this futile debate of defending guns like some kind of power that acts on its own."It's almost like the ""Taxation defends property and conscription protects freedom"" speech that I got when I was a kid, which was, to be polite, counterintuitive.""Denmark and the World Bank work together with other member governments to finance projects, design policies and deliver programs to combat poverty in the developing world.""Tweet During her Thursday press conference, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that Wednesday's sweeping gun control defeat in the Democrat-controlled  Senate is a setback, but not the end, of Democrats' gun control efforts.""Further, to follow your reasoning would defeat taxation of the lion's share of services that are part of the sale of taxable items.""Several times the Urartian kings of this period claimed, probably with justification, to have defeated Assyrian armies: Argishti reported victories over the Assyrians in his sixth and seventh regnal years, when he operated in the Zab and Lake Urmia areas; and Sarduri II defeated the Assyrian king Ashur-nirari V in the upper basin of the Tigris River about 753.""And this awakening could well be supported by a force of protest that has now somewhat waned but remains latent, that of the Venezuelan students who played a crucial role in defeating a 2007 referendum that would have openly converted Venezuela to the Cuban model of government."Now an anti-gun activist writes a letter in the tone that Joe wrote to express his sympathy for the father but goes on to defend a no guns policy.People like Rebecca Peters see this as a golden opportunity becasue they know that people who accept gun control are not going to fight gun control or be motivated to even object."On the other side of the paradox, more people keeping and bearing arms means there's a larger constituency to fight new gun control, so I'm not certain it really helps our opponents any."Another: Nobody who accepts gun control will fight gun control.Best they learn how to fight gun control.They are never going to fight gun control becasue they ACCEPT gun control as valid.The opposition Movement for Democratic Change is divided over whether to fight Senate elections on 26

Queen Elizabeth 1 (1558-1603) spent much of her reign warding off the threat from Catholic Europe, and important recusants (people who refused to attend Church of England services) and others who might have opposed her rule were locked tip in the Tower."So are you arguing that the founders opposed private gun ownership?Has the NRA organised and helped members gain strength in opposing gun control?Even Carter's grandson in state legislature voted open carry as a Democrat knowing opposing gun rights is the kiss of death politically."There is no understandable logic in opposing a firearm that prevents non owners like teen agers and children, thieves from firing it."But one reason for opposing smart guns is for the same reason many oppose voter ID laws-it is overly restrictive and will hurt minority groups especially hard due to the higher costs.The composition of leaders who overcame poverty to achieve the pinnacle of success in business changed very little over the course of the twentieth century.It works with governments to develop and finance programmes and projects that enable poor rural people to improve their livelihoods sustainably and overcome poverty themselves.They come to Kansas City to work together to develop skills essential in overcoming poverty in their communities."For those of us trying to oppose the U.S. empire, our primary task is organizing people in the United States to resist these imperial policies."I think it is the T's who will resist any tax reform that generates more revenue and any budget cuts to the military."Follow the story of Virginia Assembly member John Frye (played by the young Jack Lord) during the crucial period when the colonists resisted British taxation without representation, met force with force and chose revolution."3. a terroristic method of governing or of resisting a government."Meantime, a survivor of the Virginia Tech mass-shooting and a relative of a student killed in the 2007 tragedy circulated an e-mail urging Democrats to oppose Deeds because he resists gun control.""I agree that gun control will struggle to make a difference in the U.S, though for different reason but the smaller measures of controls are worth trying.""Tackling poverty will require a multi-faceted approach and a coordinated effort by social service agencies, non-profit organizations, and community volunteers.""and that is the best you can do.... again I don't attack gun owners, I am rather fond of mine- I do attack cry babies...."Congress and the public now attack gun owners for a failure in the reporting system!I suspect most of them don't even believe the bovine droppings they proffer but they feel a need to attack gun ownership for reasons that have nothing to do with a desire to decrease crimeThis thread points out the father like all of the rest of the anti-gun people skip over the facts and reality and jump right to teh eeeeevil guns owe da horrra!!! Im sure the first three victims that had their ****ing skulls bashed and were stabbed to death...their families can take comfort in knowing that the anti-gun crowd will ignore them and use the entire event as a springboard to attack guns."When we believe He redeemed us from the curse of poverty and wrap all of our words and actions around that belief, then we strengthen the faith barrier against the attack of poverty."He attacked the government of Juan MartÃ_n de PueyrredÃ_n and was banished (1817)."In contrast, many slaveowners in the early nineteenth century defended a strong national government as the best bulwark against both slave revolts and the ""leveling tendencies"" of non-slaveholders."You are willing to give away your rights and not fight gun control.They are not organised to fight gun control or protect their rights.I live for the day when there is a website that shows what organisations are doing to fight gun control.Firearm owners seem to be convinced the way to fight gun control is to instil some sort of appreciation for guns.Firearm organisations provably have absolutely no idea of how to fight gun control and show no sign of figuring it out even if told."They will fight for gun rights to their dying breath (just as I would) the entire time screaming liberty while riding a bald eagle, yet are unbelievably anti-weed, anti-porn, and anti-gay.""According to the free market ideology, the best way to fight global hunger and improve the economic situation of farmers in developing countries is through trade and investment liberalization, production for export, and cuts in domestic support."The sad news is with the exception of very few no firearm organisation is doing anything of the slightest value in fighting gun control.Fighting gun control?Imagine that a person who has surrendered actually thinks he is fighting gun control.I beg your pardon but if there was any organisation effectively fighting gun control I would know about it.BTW if anyone is fighting gun control in California how come they have not made one singe dent in gun controls advance that has stuck."They criticise the movement on the grounds that, There is no discussion of even the possibility of founding powerful new political parties, fighting elections, winning office and forming governments with a mandate for fundamental economic and social change "" (p.106).""Bruce Springsteen and Pete Seeger have recorded the folk classic ""Hobo's Lullaby"" for ""Give US Your Poor,"" a multi-artist CD devoted to fighting homelessness.Appleseed Recordings will release the disc Sept. 25."Fighting poverty index"While ordinary Americans are busy earning a living, taking care of their families and paying their taxes, their hard-earned tax dollars are being used to pay for lobbyists who are fighting for higher taxes and bigger government.""The company has fought taxation at the state level, and a measure proposed at ALEC would have allowed companies to operate untaxed in states even if they advertise, hold trade shows or work through subsidiaries."This aid enabled Europeans to overcome the poverty with which many of them struggled initially."If it knows any better the number of laws on the US books would have reduced and California, Maryland and others would not be buckling under gun control attack."But gun control is theft - plain and simple - and I intend to attack gun control without talking specifically about guns."Opposition parties in Thailand used the issue to attack the government, which initially backed the heritage listing.""What I respected is that she didn't use it to attack the firearm, it was just something she associated with her trauma and honestly I can't blame her for having that scar, it's a pretty scary thing to be involved in."What's the best way to attack credit card debt?He is working with CIRA on a statewide effort to attack poverty with sustainability initiatives."They attack ""rich people"" while enjoying all the spoils of their luck, I have zero problems with earned wealth, but these clowns literally lucked out in life.""Manger went on the offensive with ads that accused the Democratic freshman representative of driving Southampton College into bankruptcy while he was an administrator at the school, while NRCC ads attacked the incumbent for not supporting U.S. troops."The battle of government agencies continues in San Mateo between the City and the San Mateo Union High School District about the cost of using each others' fields.The news came after the Bank of England cut interest rates to a record low of 1.5 percent on Thursday as it and the government battle to prevent Britain falling further into a recession that has cost thousands of jobs.The NRA has cultivated this idea of a massive battle for gun rights.Islamic militants with ties to Al Qaeda have been battling the government and its Ethiopian allies since their combined forces pushed the Islamists from the capital in December 2006.But how does one oppose a campaign by gun control without strategy or knowing what you are fighting?"That firearm organisations were and still are ineffective, useless and have no idea of how to combat gun control."They are valued partners in an effort to combat hunger in America.An analysis conducted in September for FRAC by Peter D.
